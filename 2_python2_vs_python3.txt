what is the difference between python2 and python3

there are quite libraries that have stoped working in the python2 version.

| Aspect              | Python 2                                    | Python 3                                    |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Print Statement     | Uses the syntax `print "Hello, World!"`     | Uses the syntax `print("Hello, World!")`     |
| Division            | Uses integer division by default (5/2 = 2)  | Uses true division by default (`5/2` = `2.5`)|
| Unicode Support     | Limited Unicode support                     | Full Unicode support                        |
| Syntax              | Uses `raw_input()` for user input           | Uses `input()` for user input                |
| Iteration           | Uses `xrange()` for efficient looping       | Uses `range()` for looping                   |
| Exception Handling  | Uses `except Exception, e` syntax           | Uses `except Exception as e` syntax          |
| Libraries           | Some libraries are not Python 3 compatible  | Libraries are generally Python 3 compatible  |
